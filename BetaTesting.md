# Major Project beta testing

 ## Decsription
 
this will compile any complaints, suggestions, and adjustments made conserning the code during beta testing
 ## beta tester #1 Mx. Walker
 - help Screen is unclear(very)
 - how to exit help screen is not displayed
 - column is misspelled in code

 - General Suggestion: 
    clairify help Screen
 

## beta tester #2 
 
 - some sort of compatible chordSequence function 
 - a visual indicator of what's playing at the time
     (change in color? a moving line? something like that idk)
 - premade chords to choose
     (eg: if you pressed "G" then you get a Gmajor chord on a collum)
 - also nice would be able to choose where on the grid the chord apears in the grid
