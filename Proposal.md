# Major Project Proposal

 ## Decsription
 
 I am planning go make an adjustable array of different sequential notes(prolly C scale for ease of use and sanity), that you can try out different chords and sequences with. Basically a digital chord synth. 
 
 ## Must have List
 // audio goals
  - a horizontal AutoPlay Function 
     (plays notes left to right in the grid)
  - a vertical chord function 
     (plays all notes in a collum simultaniously)
     
 // visual goals
  - icons corresponding to notes
     (eg; an E would display E, a Gb would display Gb)
  - a way to change Key (cause C is easy yet boring)
     (using either keyboard or an on screen button, might reset the board :0) 

## nice to have List 
 
 - some sort of compatible chordSequence function 
 - a visual indicator of what's playing at the time
     (change in color? a moving line? something like that idk)
 - premade chords to choose
     (eg: if you pressed "G" then you get a Gmajor chord on a collum)
 - also nice would be able to choose where on the grid the chord apears in the grid
