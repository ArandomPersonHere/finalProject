# Major Project Proposal

 ## Decsription
 
 I am planning go make an adjustable array of different sequential notes(prolly C scale for ease of use and sanity), that you can try out different chords and sequences with. basically a digital chord synth. 
 
 ## Must have List
 
  - a horizontal AutoPlay Function (plays notes left to right in the grid)
  - a vertical chord function (plays all notes in a collum simultaniously)
  - icons corresponding to notes
  (eg; an E would display E, a Gb would display Gb)

## nice to have List 
 
 - some sort of compatible chordSequence function 
 - a visual indicator of what's playing at the time(change in color? a moving line? something like that idk)
 - premade chords to choose(eg: if you pressed "G" then you get a Gmajor chord on a collum)
 - also nice would be able to choose where on the grid the chord apears in the grid
